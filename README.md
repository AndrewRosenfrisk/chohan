# Cho-Han

## About

Cho-han is a dice game played in gambling houses of feudal Japan. Two six-sided dice are 
rolled in a cup, and gamblers must guess if the sum is even (cho) or odd (han). The house 
takes a small cut of all winnings. The simple random number generation and basic math used 
to determine odd or even sums make this project especially suitable for beginners. More 
information about Cho-han can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho-han.
